# X-NUCLEO-IHM01A1

The X-NUCLEO-IHM01A1 is a stepper motor driver expansion board based on the L6474.
This device uses SPI to communicate. A SPI instance is required to access to the registers of the motor driver.
It provides an affordable and easy-to-use solution for driving a stepper motor in your STM32 Nucleo project. 
The advanced current control of the L6474 and a complete set of protection features 
offer high levels of both performance and robustness.

## Examples

There is 1 example with the X-NUCLEO-IHM01A1 library.
* X_NUCLEO_IHM01A1_HelloWorld: This application provides a simple example of usage of the X-NUCLEO-IHM01A1 
Stepper Motor Control Expansion Board. It shows how to use one stepper motor connected to the board, moving the rotor to specific positions, with given speed values, direction of rotations, etc.
